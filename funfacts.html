			<h3>More Rare than a Diamond?</h3>
			<p><strong>Rubies, sapphires and emeralds are all more rare than diamonds.</strong> Rubies and sapphires are actually the same mineral -<em>corundum.</em>  The basic chemical formula of corundum is <em>Al2O3,</em> but traces of iron stain the mineral red (ruby) while traces of chromium or titanium stain the mineral blue (sapphire).</p>

			<h3>Natural Chalk</h3>
			<p>Natural chalk is actually made up of millions of little fossils called cocoliths which were the round shell of animal called cocolithophores</p>

			<h3>What is the hardest natural substance on Earth?</h3>
			<p><strong>A diamond is the hardest naturally occurring material known</strong>, due to its strong covalent bonding, Yet, due to important structural weaknesses, diamond's toughness is only fair to good.Diamond is extremely strong owing to the structure of its carbon atoms, where each carbon atom has four neighbors joined to it with covalent bonds.</p>

			<h3>Diamonds aren't all Transparent</h3>
			<p>Not all diamonds are transparent. They come in a variety of colors (called <em>fancies</em>), including yellow, green, blue, orange, brown (<em>champagne</em>), purple, grey, black (called carbanado, recently shown to be meteroic), milky white, pink, and red.  Red is by far the rarest. </p>

			<h3>Most common Mineral on Earth?</h3>
			<p><strong>Quartz is the most common mineral on Earth.</strong> Nearly all the sand in sandstone, in the deserts of the world and on its riverbeds and beaches is quartz.</p>

			<h3>What is Scoria?</h3>
			<p><strong>Scoria is a dark-colored igneous rock</strong> with abundant round bubble-like cavities called vesicles. It ranges in color from black or dark gray to deep reddish brown. Small pieces look like the ash produced in a coal furnace resulting in particles of scoria being called "cinders" and the small volcanoes that erupt scoria to be called "cinder cones"</p>

			<h3>Where does Beach Sand come from?</h3>
			<p>Sand is basically the material you get when you get a breakdown in rocks, when the rocks weather and decompose over hundreds of thousands and millions of years and yet it's much more.</p>

			<h3>Largest Crator on Earth?</h3>
			<p><strong>The largest crater on Earth</strong> is over 500km (or 311 miles) wide, partly located beneath Mexico. It was created following an asteroid impact 65 million years ago that may have led to the extinction of the dinosaurs.

			<h3>Moon crators Vs. Earth Crators</h3>
			<p>Why doesn't the earth have as many craters as the moon?</strong>  And the answer to that, is we do. However, our craters have gradually eroded away or been overgrown by vegetation.</p>

			<h3>Mount Kilimanjaro</h3>
			<p><strong>On the slopes of Mount Kilimanjaro,</strong> at c9,000 feet (2,800 metres) the only animals around Kilimanjaro are moles, rats and birds of prey. At higher altitudes there is just the odd spider that can reach the summit and survive the freezing temperatures!</p>

			<h3>Smallest Mountains on Earth?</h3>

			<h3>The Highest Altitude</h3>
			<p>The peak of Mount Everest is 8,850 meters (29,035 feet) above sea level. No other mountain on Earth has a higher altitude. Mount Everest is called the world's highest mountain because it has the highest elevation above sea level. </p>

			<h3> Lifetime supply of minerals for the average person</h3>

			<h3>Geodes</h3>
			<p><strong>Geodes form inside already existing hollows within volcanic or sedimentary rock.</strong> Groundwater laden with silica and other minerals fills these hollows. Over thousands of years minerals precipitate out of the water, leaving a silica gel on the interior walls of the cavity that hardens into rock as it dries. As this process reoccurs, through leaching, layers begin to form distinct, inwardly pointing crystals. Geodes that are empty missed these later cycles.</p>

			<h3>How many different Minerals are there?</h3>
			<p>There are roughly 3,000 known minerals, although only about 200 are of major importance. Approximately 50-100 new minerals are described each year.</p>
