## Observations

- Titles needed to be changed as they acted like categories
- no questions were asked
- some titles were harder to place in a category 
- there was a few common groupings, such as the Rocks category
- Some groupings didn't make sense to me, or category names, such as "fancy facts"
- I realized that my titles needed to be changed as it was hard to categorize them
