	<h4>Etna's Fireworks, Lava</h4>
	<h5><em>Photograph by Carsten Peter</em></h5>
		  <p>Italy's Mount Etna provides a vivid image of one of the birthplaces of igneous rock during a night eruption. Igneous rock forms when magma cools and solidifies. (Lava is magma that has reached the Earth's surface.) Etna also shows off the etymology of igneous, from the Latin word for fire.</p>

	<h4>Devils Tower, Wyoming</h4>
	<h5><em>Photograph by John G. Wilbanks</em></h5>
		  <p>Known as an igneous intrusion, the 1,267-foot-tall Devils Tower formed when molten rock intruded into the existing rocks. The formation wasn't visible, wind and water began to erode the sedimentary rock surrounding the tower faster than the harder igneous rock, Devils Tower was born.</p>

	<h4>Sedimentary Honeycomb</h4>
	<h5><em>Photograph by John McKenna/Alamy</em></h5>
		  <p>This section of eroded sedimentary rock on Elgol Beach on the Island of Skye, Scotland, mimics bone. Erosion shaped its honeycombed appearance.Salt from seawater continue to eat away at the rock, gradually expanding the small pits and forming the current honeycomb shape.</p>

	<h4>Giant's Causeway</h4>
	<h5><em>Photograph by Jim Richardson</em></h5>
		  <p>Stepping stones into the sea, these basaltic columns of the Giant's Causeway in Northern Ireland formed from volcanic activity some 50 million to 60 million years ago. Geologists classify igneous rock by its texture. You would need a microscope to see the grains in the 40,000-some basalt columns that form the Giant's Causeway.</p>

	<h4>Birch Tor</h4>
	<h5><em>Photograph by Martin Bodman</em></h5>
		  <p>A tor is a large, free-standing residual mass that rises abruptly from the surrounding smooth and gentle slopes of a rounded hill summit or ridge crest. Tors may develop in a range of different rock types including granite, volcanic rocks metamorphic rocks or hard sedimentary rocks such as quartzite. They are the result of millions of years of weathering.</p>

	<h4>Promontory</h4>
	<h5><em>Photograph by Roberto Garrido</em></h5>
		  <p>A promontory is a prominent mass of land that overlooks lower-lying land or a body of water (where it may be called a peninsula or headland).
Most promontories either are formed from a hard ridge of rock that has resisted the erosive forces that have removed the softer rock to the sides of it, or are the high ground that remains between two river valleys where they form a confluence.</p>

	<h4>Oozing Lava</h4>
	<h5><em>Photograph by Frans Lanting</em></h5>
		  <p>Oozing lava acts as a seal over fractured ground in Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. Once the lava from Kilauea Crater cools, it becomes known as igneous rock, since it formed from molten material. Geologists would also call it extrusive rock because it solidified on the Earth's surface.</p>

	<h4>White Rock</h4>
	<h5><em>Photograph by Marli Miller, University of Oregon</em></h5>
		  <p>A river of white rock snakes within its darker surroundings, providing evidence that it had a greater viscosity than the darker rock. Geologists refer to this kind of formation as ptygmatic folding. A penny shows the scale of the size of this folding, which is highly irregular.</p>

	<h4>Devils Tower, Wyoming</h4>
	<h5><em>Photograph by CuboImages srl/Alamy</em></h5>
		  <p>Bulldozers work in a marble quarry in Th√°sos, Greece. The Earth's heat and pressure alter limestone into marble, which can range in color from black to white. The ancient Greeks recognized marble's durability, using it to build the Parthenon in Athens. Marble, a metamorphic rock, forms when limestone re-crystallizes.</p>

	<h4>Ireland Cliffs</h4>
	<h5><em>Photograph by CuboImages srl/Alamy</em></h5>
		  <p>Cliffs are formed as erosion landforms due to the processes of erosion and weathering that produce them. Cliffs are common on coasts, in mountainous areas, escarpments and along rivers. Cliffs are usually formed by rock that is resistant to erosion and weathering.  Igneous rocks such as granite and basalt also often form cliffs.</p>

	<div class="description">
	<h4>Stack</h4>
	<h5><em>Photograph by Emanuele Petrachi</em></h5>
		  <p>A stack is a geological landform consisting of a steep and often vertical column or columns of rock in the sea near a coast, isolated by erosion.[1] Stacks are formed over time by wind and water. Stacks typically form in horizontally-bedded sedimentary or volcanic rocks, particularly on limestone cliffs. These rock types' medium hardness means medium resistance to abrasive and attritive erosion.</p>

		  <h4>Ripples of Pahoehoe</h4>
	<h5><em>Photograph by Jeff Gnass</em></h5>
		  <p>Cooled lava lies in icing-like ripples in Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. This image shows ropy pahoehoe, a type of basaltic lava that forms when solidifying lava meets an obstruction. Hot lava underneath the hardening crust continues to move it along, forming wrinkles in the process.</p>

	<div class="description">
		  <h4>Checkerboard Mesa</h4>
	<h5><em>Photograph by Larry Fellows</em></h5>
		  <p>Horizontal furrows and vertical fractures in the bedrock give Checkerboard Mesa in Utah's Zion National Park its name. Erosion shaped the Navajo sandstone of the mesa on the edge of the Colorado Plateau, near the east entrance of the park. It's a spectacular sight!</p>

	<img src="img/gneiss-lines.jpg" alt="Gneiss Lines" />
	<div class="description">
		  <h4>Gneiss Lines</h4>
	<h5><em>Photograph by Marli Miller, University of Oregon</em></h5>
		  <p>As if an avant-garde painting, younger white rock intrudes in a tapestry of gneiss. Since the white rock doesn't show the same evidence of folding as the surrounding gneiss, it offers proof that it is a younger intrusion. Gneiss, a metamorphic rock, can be commonly found in Precambrian areas.</p>

	<h5><em>Photograph taken by Mark A. Wilson</em></h5>
		  <p>Regional metamorphism, also known as dynamic metamorphism, is the name given to changes in great masses of rock over a wide area. Rocks can be metamorphosed simply by being at great depths below the Earth's surface, subjected to high temperatures and the great pressure caused by the immense weight of the rock layers above.</p>

		  <h4>Crag, Sea Cliffs C</h4>
	<h5><em>Photograph taken by Mark A. Wilson</em></h5>
		  <p>A crag is a steep or rugged cliff or rock face. Coastal erosion may lead to the formation of sea cliffs along a receding coastline .The location of the world's highest sea cliffs depends also on the definition of <em>cliff</em> that is used. The Guinness record books claim it is Kalaupapa, Hawaii,[2] at 1,010 m high.</p>
