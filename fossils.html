			<h2>What are Fossils?</h2>
			<p><strong>Fossils are the preserved remains of plants or animals.</strong> For such remains to be considered fossils, scientists have decided they have to be over <em>10,000 years old.</em> There are two main types of fossils, <em>body fossils</em> and <em>Metrace fossils.</em> Body fossils are the preserved remains of a plant or animal's body. Trace fossils are the remains of the activity of an animal, such as preserved trackways, footprints, fossilized egg shells, and nests. The totality of fossils, both discovered and undiscovered, and their placement in fossiliferous, <em>fossil-containing</em>, rock formations and sedimentary layers, <em>strata</em> is known as the fossil record.</p>

          <h2>Process of a Fossil</h2>
           <p>When animals, plants and other organisms die, they typically decay completely. But sometimes, when the conditions are just right, they're preserved as fossils. Several different physical and chemical processes create fossils, freezing, drying and encasement, such as in tar or resin, can create whole-body fossils that preserve bodily tissues. These fossils represent the organisms as they were when living, but they're very rare.Most organisms become fossils when they're changed through various other means.</p> 
		   
		   <p>The heat and pressure from being buried in sediment can sometimes cause the tissues of organisms, including plant leaves and the soft body parts of fish, reptiles and marine invertebrates, to release hydrogen and oxygen, leaving behind a residue of carbon. This process, <em>which is called carbonization, or distillation,</em> yields a detailed carbon impression of the dead organism in sedimentary rock The most common method of fossilization is called permineralization, or petrification. After an organism's soft tissues decay in sediment, the hard parts, <em>particularly the bones,</em> are left behind. Water seeps into the remains, and minerals dissolved in the water seep into the spaces within the remains, where they form crystals. These crystallized minerals cause the remains to harden along with the encasing sedimentary rock.</p>
		   
		   <p>In another fossilization process, called replacement, the minerals in groundwater replace the minerals that make up the bodily remains after the water completely dissolves the original hard parts of the organism. Fossils also form from molds and casts. If an organism completely dissolves in sedimentary rock, it can leave an impression of its exterior in the rock, called an external mold. If that mold gets filled with other minerals, it becomes a cast. An internal mold forms when sediments or minerals fill the internal cavity of an organism, such as a shell or skull, and the remains dissolve.</p>

          <h2>Paleontology and Fossils</h2>
           <p><strong>Paleontology is the branch of biology that studies the forms of life that existed in former geologic periods, primarily by studying fossils.</strong> The only direct way we have of learning about dinosaurs is by studying fossils. Fossils are the remains of ancient animals and plants, the traces or impressions of living things from past geologic ages, or the traces of their activities. Fossils have been found on every continent on Earth. The word fossil comes from the Latin word fossilis, which means, <em>dug up.</em></p>

		<h3>Sources of Evidence:</h3> 
		  <ul>
			<li><strong>Body Fossils</strong></li> The most common types are wood, bones, and shells. Fossilisation is a rare event, and most fossils are destroyed by erosion or metamorphism before they can be observed. Hence the fossil record is very incomplete, increasingly so further back in time.
			<li><strong>Trace Fossils</strong></li> They consist mainly of tracks and burrows, but also include coprolites (fossil feces) and marks left by feeding.Trace fossils are particularly significant because they represent a data source that is not limited to animals with easily fossilized hard parts, and they reflect organisms' behaviours.
			<li><strong>Geochemical Observations</strong></li> Geochemical observations may help to deduce the global level of biological activity, or the affinity of a certain fossil. For example geochemical features of rocks may reveal when life first arose on Earth, and may provide evidence of the presence of eucaryotic cells, the type from which all multicellular organisms are built.

          <p>There are lots of different tools, equipment, and gear that geologists have access to. What tools they use depends on the specific job and the type of geologist.</p>
