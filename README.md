# Rocks, Minerals & Gemstones

I chose this topic because I have always had an interest in geology and earth sciences, and have plenty of access to the right knowledge regarding the subject. The earth produces some beautiful rocks and gems and I would like to highlight their beauty and their information through this assignment. 

## Purpose

This is a school project where I will learn about making design systems for larger websites. I want to learn more about the services we will be using, such as Github, and I am interested in learning more ways to improve my coding for better looking and user-friendly websites. The website should provide an easy to follow format with the appropriate information regarding the subject matter.
